The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Prescreen (does this person feel confident in their JS Knowledge)

1. What is the difference between const, let, and var?
 - Const.
  - You can't point a const to a different pointer, Immutable. But you can modify that, you add properties to an object or items to an array
 - Let
  - You can change the pointer but it's only going to be scoped to the closure

 - Var
  - is hoisted to the top, meaning that const and let, if you trying to access them before they going to throw a reference error, var will just throw udefined

- Explain prototypical inheritance
- What is 'this' mean in JavaScript?
- What is the data structure of the DOM?
- What is a Stack and a Queue? How would you create those data structures in JavaScript?
- How can you tell if an image element is loaded on a page?
- What is call() and apply()?
- What is event delegation and what are the performance tradeoffs?
- What is a Worker? When would you use one?

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
