          I’m a full-stack developper looking for a new role in an exciting
          company. When writing JavaScript code, I mostly use React, but I can
          adapt to whatever tools are required. I’m based in Montreal, Canada,
          but I’m happy working remotely and have experience in remote teams.
          When I’m not coding, you’ll find me outdoors. I love being out in
          nature whether that’s going for a walk, run or cycling. I’d love you
          to check out my work.
